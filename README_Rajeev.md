# GoBear Assessment


## No clarity in the task to be performed

Unfortunately, the instructions for task to be performed are very unclear. 

A running Drupal site has Database besides the code. There is no mention in the assessment instructions about the database.

Installation of Drupal 8 can not be completed unless install is run and MySQL database is created with Drupal tables.


## What I have done 


Used given composer.json and used "composer install" command to create the codebase required for Drupal.

Composer install is newer alternate to old "drush dl" command - composer will also download other dependencies.

After the composer install, I used browser to complete the Drupal installation.

That requires a new  database. I have used box116 as database with MySQL user rkarajgi.

In the Drupal installation, I have given GoBear as user=1 (admin) with Assessment1234 as the Drupal login password.

I have taken the dump of the mysql database and it is available as gobear_site_db.sql file
